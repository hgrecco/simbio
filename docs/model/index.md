# Model creation

SimBio provides two approaches to define a model:

- static or class-based, and
- dynamic or programmatic

The static approach is recommended,
as it integrates with editor support,
offering auto-completion and refactoring capabilities.
Instead,
the dynamic approach is useful
to test many model variations.
